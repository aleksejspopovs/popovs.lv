		<p>My name is Aleksejs&nbsp;Popovs. I usually go by my first name, you can pronounce it like &lsquo;Aleks.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I am originally from Riga, Latvia, where I graduated from the Riga State Gymnasium #1 in 2016. I got a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science and in Philosophy from MIT in 2020.</p>

		<p>I care about building computer systems that respect their users and keep them safe against real-world threats. I also like philosophy of language, metaphysics, and <a href='http://www.last.fm/user/popovalexey'>weird music</a> (which I strongly believe should be <a href='https://bandcamp.com/aleksejspopovs'>purchased DRM-free</a>, not streamed).</p>

		<p>I work as a Security Engineer at Duolingo. Before, I have worked on improving the performance of the open-source zero-knowledge cryptography libraries <a href='https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark'>libsnark</a> and <a href='https://github.com/scipr-lab/libiop'>libiop</a> and interned on the Product Security team at Dropbox and with the Cryptography Services practice at NCC Group.</p>
