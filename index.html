		<p>My name is Aleksejs&nbsp;Popovs. I usually go by my first name, you can pronounce it like &lsquo;Aleks.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I am originally from Riga, Latvia, where I graduated from the Riga State Gymnasium #1 in 2016. I got a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science and in Philosophy from MIT in 2020.</p>

		<p>Now I live in Pittsburgh, PA, where I am working as a Security Engineer at Figma.</p>

		<p>I like <a href='https://www.strava.com/athletes/97331675'>riding my bike</a>, learning about the postal service and <a href='https://www.postcrossing.com/user/ejs'>mailing things</a>, making <a href='https://twitter.com/aleksejspopovs/status/1543992037090918406'>silly</a> <a href='https://twitter.com/aleksejspopovs/status/1535712148940378112'>things</a> out of paper, and <a href='https://bandcamp.com/aleksejspopovs'>buying DRM-free music</a>. I would like it if computing was a little bit slower, quirkier, and happened at a smaller scale.</p>

		<p>I tried writing <a href='https://kitchen.floo.rw.ax/museum'>a blog</a> but it did not go very far despite all of my investment in configuring the static site generator and picking a funny domain. Now I'm trying again <a href='https://cohost.org/ejs?page=0'>on Cohost</a>.</p>

		<p>I have previously worked at Duolingo, interned at Dropbox and NCC Group, and worked on improving the performance of the open-source zero-knowledge cryptography library libsnark.</p>

		<p>If you'd like to know how I'm doing, check out <a href='https://twitter.com/aleksejspopovs'>my twitter</a>. If you'd like to say hi, email me at <a href='mailto:aleksejs@popovs.lv'>aleksejs@popovs.lv</a>.</p>
