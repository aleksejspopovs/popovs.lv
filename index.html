		<p>My name is Aleksejs&nbsp;Popovs. I usually go by my first name, you can pronounce it like &lsquo;Aleks.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I am originally from Riga, Latvia, where I graduated from the Riga State Gymnasium #1 in 2016. I got a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science and in Philosophy from MIT in 2020.</p>

		<p>Now I live in Pittsburgh, PA, where I am working as a Security Engineer at Duolingo.</p>

		<p>I like systems that put users in control of their data, allow for complex customization and extension, and guide users towards making good decisions around security and sharing. I also like the post office, birds, philosophy of language, and <a href='http://www.last.fm/user/popovalexey'>weird music</a> (which I strongly believe should be <a href='https://bandcamp.com/aleksejspopovs'>purchased DRM-free</a>, not streamed). I have a little blog called <a href='https://kitchen.floo.rw.ax/museum'>the kitchen floor wax museum</a>.</p>

		<p>In the past, I have worked on improving the performance of the open-source zero-knowledge cryptography libraries <a href='https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark'>libsnark</a> and <a href='https://github.com/scipr-lab/libiop'>libiop</a> and interned on the Product Security team at Dropbox and with the Cryptography Services practice at NCC Group.</p>

		<p>If you'd like to know how I'm doing, check out <a href='https://twitter.com/aleksejspopovs'>my twitter</a>. If you'd like to say hi, email me at <a href='mailto:aleksejs@popovs.lv'>aleksejs@popovs.lv</a>.</p>
